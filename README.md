# project-example-aws

This example can be used to initialize a new project using `provider-aws`. By
default it comes with an `XStorageBucket` XRD and a matching composition
function which creates an S3 bucket. It also creates the corresponding unit and
e2e tests.

## Usage

To use this example, run the following command:

```shell
up project init -e upbound/project-example-aws <project-name>
```
